# PruebaBot
Bot development and Flask testing with Python

## Get Started
Python3 and PIP (Package Installer for Python) needed, if u don't know hot to install Python and PIP, see: [Python3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

Inside of the project folder, install all the project's dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Development server inside Text Editor or IDE
Just execute the code. Example: In Visual Studio Code you need to press `Ctrl+F5` for a dev server; then navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app WON'T automatically reload if you change any of the source files, except static rendered files like `site.css`.

## Development server outside Text Editor or IDE
Use the following steps from a terminal:

1 - Set an environment variable for FLASK_APP. On Linux and macOS, use `export set FLASK_APP=webapp;` on Windows use set `FLASK_APP=webapp`.

2 - Navigate into the simple_app folder (`cd ...`), then launch the program using `python3 -m flask run` (Linux/macOS) or `python -m flask run` (Windows). The commands `python` and `py` are equivalent.

## Other Important Commands
For starting a new virtual environment in VSC, use `py -m venv env`, where "venv" is the (customizable) name of de environment.

For updating the requirements.txt file, use `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
